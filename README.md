# TenProbsInChE
## A Collection of Ten Problems in Chemical Engineering


This collection of problems was originally distributed at the ASEE Chemical Engineering Summer School held in Snowbird, Utah on August 13, 1997 by Professor professor Michael B. Cutlip (Department of Chemical Engineering, Box U-222, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269-3222). Later on, in 1998 he published an article in [Computer Applications in Engineering Education journal](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0542(1998)6:3%3C169::AID-CAE6%3E3.0.CO;2-B/abstract). The solution was provided by Prof. Cutlip and his colleagues using six different software packages including:

* Polymath
* Excel
* Matlab
* Maple
* Mathematica
* Mathcad

The codes by Prof. Cutlip can be downloaded from [Polymath Software Page](http://polymath-software.com/ASEE/index.htm).

## Purpose
These problems cover different topics in chemical engineering for examle:
* Energy and mass balances
* Thermodynamics
* Feat transfer
* Fluid flow
* Mass transfer
* Separation processes
* Chemical reaction engineering (CRE)
* Process dynamics and control

To solve these problems basic numerical methods are used. These are:
* Single nonlinear algebraic equation
* Linear and nonlinear algebraic equations
* Linear and nonlinear regression
* Ordinary differential equations (IVP and BVP)
* Simultaneous differential and algebraic equations (DAE)

## What is this repository?
This repository introduces the solution to the collection of ten problems (in brief TenProbsInChE) using Python, Fortran and Matlab. The codes presented here are clean and simple implementation with pedagogical purpose in mind.
Each folder contains the codes in dedicated programming language.
